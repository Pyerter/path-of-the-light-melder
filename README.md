# path-of-the-light-melder
This repository contains a publicly available, free game with source code available. The goal is to showcase my work and skill in addition to allowing those learning Unity to use some of the techniques I utilize in this project.

### Downloading Packages
I've created some packages in this project in the folder Assets/ScriptPackages/.

To download one of these packages in unity, use one of the following urls:
```
https://github.com/Pyerter/path-of-the-light-melder.git?path=/Assets/ScriptPackages/BufferedInput#dev
https://github.com/Pyerter/path-of-the-light-melder.git?path=/Assets/ScriptPackages/SignalMessaging#dev
```

The "#dev" flag at the end of the url specifies the branch. To change the dependency to another branch, change "#dev" to "#branch-name".
